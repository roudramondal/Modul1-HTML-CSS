<p>I would like to <small>begin </small>by drawing your attention to the title of this lecture: "<b>Religious Belief</b> and <em>Public</em> Morality: A Catholic Governor's Perspective." I was not invited to speak on "<strong>Church and State</strong>" generally. Certainly not "Mondale vs. Reagan." The subject assigned is difficult enough. I will try not to do more than I've been asked.</p>
